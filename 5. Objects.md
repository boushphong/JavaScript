## Objects
### Creating Objects:
1. **Object Literal Notation:**
   The most common way to create an object is by using object literal notation, which involves enclosing key-value pairs in curly braces `{}`.
   ```javascript
   const person = {
       name: "John",
       age: 30,
       isStudent: false
   };
   ```
2. **Using the `new` Operator:**
   You can also create objects using constructor functions or by instantiating built-in constructors like `Object`. While this is less common for simple objects, it can be useful for creating instances of custom classes.
   ```javascript
   const person = new Object();
   person.name = "John";
   person.age = 30;
   person.isStudent = false;
   ```

### Accessing Object Properties:
```javascript
console.log(person.name); // Outputs: "John"
console.log(person['age']); // Outputs: 30
```

```javascript
const propertyName = "isStudent";
console.log(person[propertyName]); // Outputs: false
```

### Modifying Object Properties:
```javascript
person.age = 31;
person['isStudent'] = true;
```

### Adding and Deleting Properties:
```javascript
person.country = "USA";
```

To delete a property, you can use the `delete` keyword.

```javascript
delete person.country;
```

### Object Methods:
In JavaScript, objects can also contain methods, which are functions stored as object properties. These methods can perform actions or computations related to the object's data.

```javascript
const person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    greet: function() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
    }
};

person.greet(); // Outputs: "Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old."
```

### Object Constructors and Prototypes:
You can create multiple objects with the same structure by defining a constructor function and using the `new` keyword. Additionally, you can add methods to an object's prototype to share them among all instances created from the constructor.
```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
};

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 25);
const person2 = new Person("Bob", 32);

person1.greet(); // Outputs: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old."
person2.greet(); // Outputs: "Hello, my name is Bob and I am 32 years old."
```

### Object Destructuring (ES6):
In modern JavaScript (ES6 and later), you can use object destructuring to extract properties into individual variables:
```javascript
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name); // Outputs: "John"
console.log(age); // Outputs: 30
```
