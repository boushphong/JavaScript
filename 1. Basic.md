### Integrating JavaScript with HTML using the `<script>` tag

1. **Creating a Basic HTML Document**: Start by creating a basic HTML document.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My JavaScript Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, JavaScript!</h1>

    <!-- Your JavaScript code goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

2. **Adding JavaScript to Your HTML:**

   - The `<script>` tag is used to include JavaScript within your HTML document. You can place it in either the `<head>` or the `<body>` of your HTML document.

   - Placing it in the `<head>` allows the script to load before the page content, which can be useful for script dependencies. Placing it in the `<body>` lets the script interact with the page's content.

   ```html
   <script>
       // Your JavaScript code goes here
   </script>
   ```

   You can also include external JavaScript files by specifying a `src` attribute in the `<script>` tag:

   ```html
   <script src="myscript.js"></script>
   ```

3. **Writing JavaScript Code**: Inside the `<script>` tags, you can write your JavaScript code. Here's a simple example that displays an alert when the page loads:

```html
<script>
    // JavaScript code
    alert("Hello, JavaScript!");
</script>
```

4. **Best Practices:**
- **Separate Content and Behavior:** It's considered best practice to keep your JavaScript code separate from your HTML content. Place JavaScript in external files whenever possible to improve maintainability.
- **Use Asynchronous Loading:** If you include JavaScript in the `<head>`, consider using the `async` or `defer` attribute for better page loading performance.
- **Put Scripts at the Bottom:** If your JavaScript doesn't need to run before the page is fully loaded, place the `<script>` tag just before the closing `</body>` tag. This ensures that the page content loads first.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Use try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users.
