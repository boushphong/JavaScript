## Functions
### Defining Functions:
```javascript
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
    // Function body - code to be executed
    return result; // Optional return statement
}
```

### Calling Functions:
```javascript
const result = functionName(arg1, arg2, ...);
```

Example:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

const sum = add(3, 4); // Calls the 'add' function
console.log(sum); // Outputs 7
```

### Function Expressions:
Example of a function expression:

```javascript
const multiply = function(x, y) {
    return x * y;
};

const product = multiply(5, 6);
console.log(product); // Outputs 30
```

### Arrow Functions (ES6):
```javascript
const functionName = (parameter1, parameter2, ...) => {
    // Function body
    return result; // Optional
};
```

Example:
```javascript
const square = (x) => x * x;
const squaredValue = square(3);
console.log(squaredValue); // Outputs 9
```

### Hoisting
Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that you can use a variable or call a function before it's declared in your code, and JavaScript will still work. However, there are some important nuances to understand:

1. **Variable Hoisting:**
   When you declare a variable with `var`, it is hoisted to the top of its containing function or global scope. However, the assignment (initialization) remains in place.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   console.log(age); // Outputs: undefined
   var age = 30;
   ```

   This is interpreted by JavaScript as:
   ```javascript
   var age;
   console.log(age); // Outputs: undefined
   age = 30;
   ```

   It's important to note that although the variable is hoisted, only the declaration (var age) is moved to the top, not the initialization (age = 30).

2. **Function Hoisting:**
   Function declarations are also hoisted in JavaScript. You can call a function before declaring it in your code.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   sayHello(); // Outputs: "Hello!"
   function sayHello() {
       console.log("Hello!");
   }
   ```

   This is interpreted by JavaScript as:
   ```javascript
   function sayHello() {
       console.log("Hello!");
   }
   sayHello(); // Outputs: "Hello!"
   ```

   Function expressions (e.g., `const func = function() {...}`) are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations. Only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function itself.

3. **Let and Const Variables:**
   Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but are not initialized. This means you cannot access them before the actual declaration in the code.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   console.log(name); // Throws a ReferenceError
   let name = "Alice";
   ```

   This code throws a ReferenceError because the variable `name` is in the temporal dead zone (TDZ), and you cannot access it before the `let` declaration.

Hoisting can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not aware of how it works. To write more predictable and maintainable code:
- Always declare your variables at the top of their respective functions or blocks.
- Use `let` and `const` instead of `var` to avoid some of the issues associated with hoisting.
- Declare your functions before using them to make your code more readable and less error-prone.
